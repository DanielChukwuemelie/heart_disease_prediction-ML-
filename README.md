# heart_disease_prediction-ML-
This repository features data preprocessing, splitting, and training of a heart disease prediction model using the RandomForestClassifier estimator. Achieving an 87% accuracy rate through hyper-parameter tuning, it serves as a valuable resource for machine learning enthusiasts.
Data Preprocessing: The "Heart Disease" dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure it's ready for training and testing.

Libraries: We've imported essential libraries necessary for this project, ensuring you have the tools you need for analysis and modeling.

Data Splitting: The dataset has been split into training and testing sets for both input (X) and output (y) variables, enabling robust model evaluation.

Model Selection: Our primary model for training is the RandomForestClassifier estimator, chosen for its predictive power and versatility.

Model Development: Through hyper-parameter tuning and rigorous training, we've achieved an impressive model accuracy of 87%.

This repository serves as a resource for those interested in machine learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling, particularly in the context of heart disease prediction.
